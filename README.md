Aim: 

We plan to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) application on our mobile phones that provide an experience similar to stargazing. Currently, there are apps such as  “Night Sky” and “Sky Light” which provide similar experiences but have many features locked behind paywalls. We also plan to expand on certain features such as being able to click on a star to learn more about them and provide latest updates on the star. Possible other features may include an encyclopedia or a filter of the stars categorised according to their subtypes (e.g. white dwarfs) and a size comparison feature to showcase the scale of the universe.
