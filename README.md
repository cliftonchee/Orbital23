Motivation: 

Being avid stargazers ourselves, we feel it is a shame that there are those who have never experienced the beauty of the universe and the sheer scale of it. In light-polluted Singapore, we wanted to share a glimpse of that joy with those that were never given the opportunity, anywhere, at any time, through the convenience of their phones. In doing so, we hope that users will be more keen to learn more and appreciate the vast space that we call home.

Therefore, we intend to fill this gap between willingness to stargaze and the ability to do so by developing an AR based stargazing app. This app will allow its users to “see” the stars even through the poor conditions in Singapore.

Aim: 

We plan to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) application on our mobile phones that provide an experience similar to stargazing. Currently, there are apps such as  “Night Sky” and “Sky Light” which provide similar experiences but have many features locked behind paywalls. We also plan to expand on certain features such as being able to click on a star to learn more about them and provide latest updates on the star. Possible other features may include an encyclopedia or a filter of the stars categorised according to their subtypes (e.g. white dwarfs) and a size comparison feature to showcase the scale of the universe.
